# ng-Dynamic-Master-Forms

updated: 6/15/2017
expected v1.0.0 by July

This is an Angular 2+ module is for taking any object that is thrown at it, via a stream or hard-code. It reads the properties and builds an object with all the model data and initialized controls you would need to insert a variable shaped form. It also has various components that are usefullly reusabel for building forms manually and some advanced features e.g. histories and recursive listing. I made this to make my development process easier for big and repetitive form construction.
  Still a -WIP-
